Introduction

HouseHunt is an Android mobile application designed to help users in buying and selling homes. Our application provides strong authentication for accessing their dashboards with personalized experiences. It gives a splash screen right at the opening of the app to a decent animation of a welcoming note: “Your Dream Home is just a huntaway!” and promises a smooth user experience. Authentication is done based on the SQLite database architecture, which is in place for storing user credentials and property information. Users can sign up themselves with a unique email, log in securely, and recover forgotten passwords. “Remember Me” is implemented using SharedPreferences to ensure continuity in user experience across multiple sessions. It allows users to directly access the dashboard-to list properties for sale or to go in and find properties to buy-while all interactions are handled securely through the authenticating layer. We have used the best practices for responsive design and maintaining consistent branding across all screens within our HouseHunt app.
